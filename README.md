# Fish prompt

Customized fish prompt in inspired by [agnoster-zsh-theme](https://github.com/agnoster/agnoster-zsh-theme) showing:

* virtual environment
* failure of previous command
* elevated priviledges
* remote shell
* git branch
* git status

## Install

Requires [Powerline-patched font](https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline-fonts) to display correctly.

Copy `fish_prompt.fish` to `~/.config/fish/functions/`

## To do
* better parsing of git info
* repaint when status changes
