# Fish prompt

Customized fish prompt in inspired by [agnoster-zsh-theme](https://github.com/agnoster/agnoster-zsh-theme) showing:
* git branch
* whether branch is clean or dirty
* whether we are running local or remote shell
* whether we are root or normal user
* status of last command

## Install

Requires [Powerline-patched font](https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline-fonts) to display correctly.
Copy `fish_prompt.fish` to i`~/.config/fish/functions/`

## To do
* more detailed info about git tree
* render virtual environment nicer
* repaint when status changes
